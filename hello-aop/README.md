# 🌸 Spring Boot AOP with Custom Annotation — Concept Guide

> **Goal:** Understand how Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) works in Spring Boot using a custom annotation like `@LogExecutionTime`.

---

## 🧩 What is AOP?

**Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** helps you separate **cross-cutting concerns** — features that apply across multiple parts of an application (e.g., logging, security, performance monitoring).

Instead of writing the same code in many classes, you write it **once** in an **aspect**, and Spring automatically applies it wherever needed.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Aspect** | A class that contains cross-cutting logic | `LogExecutionTimeAspect` |
| **Advice** | The action taken by an aspect (before, after, around) | Logging execution time |
| **Join Point** | A specific point during program execution (method call) | When `greet()` is called |
| **Pointcut** | Expression defining which methods are intercepted | Methods annotated with `@LogExecutionTime` |
| **Annotation** | Marker used to trigger the aspect | `@LogExecutionTime` |
| **Weaving** | Linking aspect logic into target methods | Done automatically by Spring |

---

## ⚙️ The Flow (Step-by-Step)
User hits → /hello?name=Shrikant
↓
@Controller → GreetingController.hello()
↓
@Service → GreetingService.greet()
↓
@LogExecutionTime detected → Aspect wraps the method
↓
[AOP] Start timer
↓
Execute actual business logic
↓
[AOP] Stop timer → print execution duration
↓
Return response to user

## 🧩 Concept Summary

| Layer | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Custom Annotation** | Defines *where* aspect applies |
| **Aspect Class** | Defines *what* logic runs (e.g., measure time) |
| **Advice Method (@Around)** | Wraps around target method to run before and after it |
| **JoinPoint / ProceedingJoinPoint** | Represents the intercepted method call |
| **Spring Boot Auto-weaving** | Automatically applies aspect logic at runtime |

## 🧭 Real-World Analogy

Think of AOP like a **security checkpoint** in an airport ✈️:

- Each passenger (method call) passes through.
- The scanner (aspect) performs some action (scan).
- After scanning, the passenger proceeds to their destination.
- The scanner doesn’t change the passenger, just observes and logs.

---

## 💡 When to Use AOP

✅ Use for:
- Logging or performance monitoring
- Security checks (authentication, authorization)
- Transaction management
- Exception handling
- Auditing and metrics

🚫 Avoid for:
- Business logic
- Code that changes app state unpredictably

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- AOP keeps your **core logic clean** and **cross-cutting logic centralized**.
- You define *where* (`@annotation`) and *what* (`@Around`) once.
- The same aspect can apply to dozens of methods — no duplicate code.
- Custom annotations make it easy to target only what you need.

## 🏁 In Short

| Step | What Happens |
|------|----------------|
| 1️⃣ | User calls endpoint |
| 2️⃣ | Spring sees `@LogExecutionTime` |
| 3️⃣ | Aspect wraps the method call |
| 4️⃣ | Timer starts → method executes → timer stops |
| 5️⃣ | Duration logged in console |
| 6️⃣ | User receives normal response |

---

## 🔍 One-Line Definition

> **Spring AOP** = Smart proxy that lets you **run extra logic around method calls** using **annotations + aspects**, without touching your main code.
